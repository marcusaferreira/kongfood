 # Running the Application
 This code is using Docker Compose to run multiple containers. 
 The compose.yml file defines the services that make up the application, 
 and the `docker compose up` command starts the containers and attaches them to a network.
 To run the application, make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed, 
 then navigate to the directory containing the compose.yml file and run `docker compose up -d`.
